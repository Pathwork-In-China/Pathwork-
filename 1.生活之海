1.生活之海

Greetings. I bring you God’s blessings, my dear ones.

问候你们。我给你们带来上帝的祝福，我亲爱的人们。

From the wider perspective of the spirit, human life appears as a tableau representing the form and substance of earthly life as a sea, an ocean, on which each life is a boat. You often experience this analogy in dreams. The picture presents various aspects of life: the sea can be stormy, the sky grey, and then again the sun will shine and the waters be calm until the next storm comes along. And so it alternates until the journey reaches its destination. The destination is the firm land, the world of spirit, your true home. Thus all depends on how well you can direct your life.

从一种更广阔的精神视角看来，人类生活就像一幅活人舞台画，在这幅画中，世俗生活的形式和实质被表现为一片海、一个洋，而每个个体生命都是漂泊其中的一只船。你们经常在梦中经历这种比拟。这幅画面展现了生命的各个方面：海面有时风暴肆虐，天空也灰暗无光，然后太阳又会出现，水面也变得平静，直到下一场风暴到来。于是情况就这样交替反复，直到旅途到达尽头。旅途的目的地就是稳固的土地，精神的世界，你们真正的家。于是一切都取决于你能多好地引导自己的人生。

One person is a trained, experienced, skillful captain and as such is not afraid of danger; he directs his little boat well through the elements, and in the calm and good periods gathers strength for the next storm. Another gets nervous and loses inner control when a storm is brewing. Yet another is so scared that in his extreme fear he does not steer his boat at all, but lets it drift through the storm of life—and thus does not gain anything. You are aware, of course, that the atmospheric disturbances, thunderstorms, the hurricanes, the clouds that gather, are the tests that life brings to you. Human beings who have already been through some spiritual schooling and are a little more sensitive can use their intuition to recognize where their little boat is at a particular time.

有一个人是一位训练有素、经验丰富并且技术娴熟的船长，因此他便不害怕危险；他引导着自己的小船平稳地穿过恶劣的天气，而在平静安宁的时期就为迎接下次风暴的到来积聚着力量。另一个人在风暴酝酿时变得焦虑不安并失去了内心的控制。又有一个人，他是如此地害怕以至于在极度的恐惧中，他完全不掌控船的方向，任由它在生活的风暴中漂泊——于是他得不到任何收获。当然了，你们很清楚，那些大气扰动、雷暴、飓风以及积聚的雷云，它们都是生活带给你的考验。那些已经有过一些精神层面的经验，并且比常人更加敏感一些人们可以利用他们的直觉觉察到自己的小船在某个特定时间上所处的位置。

I would like to talk about the tests. There is hardly any group of people, be it a family or any other community, where at least one human soul will not be still so low in its development that that person becomes the plaything of the forces of darkness. This does not mean that he or she has to be an evil person. No, it is enough if such people do not accept the validity of certain spiritual laws in their lives, that they do not apply them to themselves, or that, in spite of certain very good qualities, they will not cultivate self-honesty. This alone is sufficient to become the plaything of the forces of darkness. The dark world takes its material from these currents, from the lack of self-discipline and self-awareness, from all the formations that manifest when a human being does not follow divine law.

我想要谈一谈这些考验。可以说，几乎没有任何的一群人，不管是家庭还是其他的团体，他们中间不包含这样一个个体灵魂：他（她）仍然处在自我发展的低级阶段以至于他（她）变成了黑暗力量的玩物。这并不是说他或者她一定是个邪恶的人。不是的，而是说这样一个人拒绝接受他们生活中某些精神法则的效力，或者说他们不把这些法则应用于自己，亦或者说，尽管他们有某些非常好的品质，他们不愿意培养（内心的）自我诚实。单单这一条就足以使他（她）成为黑暗力量的玩物了。黑暗世界从这些暗流中提取材料，从（人内心）缺乏自律和自觉中、从当一个人不遵从神圣法则时显现出来的一切形成物中提取材料。

Spiritual material resembles threads, fine, ray-like threads—in this case of somber color and texture —which are spun, knotted, and entangled, until there is such a tight ball of confusion that one can disentangle it only with the greatest difficulty. However, it is not only this one person who furnishes the material for the confusions, but all the other people involved in the group contribute their share, which arises from their own mistakes and weaknesses in those areas where they violate spiritual law. Thus more of the same kind of yarn is spun, until truth is no longer discernible—at least not easily—even for those whose sight is already sharper, and often it takes a great deal of effort to find the truth at all.

精神/心灵层面物质类似于线条，精致的、光束一样的线条——在目前这个例子中它们的颜色和质地是昏暗暗淡的——这些线条被旋转、打结、纠缠住，直到最后形成了一个结实的混乱之球，让人只有费尽最大力气才能解开。然而，并不是只有这一个人参与提供造成混乱的材料，而是这个群体中所有牵涉到的人都贡献出各自的一份，他们各自的材料是由于自己在各个领域违反精神法则，从而形成了各种错误和弱点而产生的。于是更多这样的线条被编织出来，直到后来哪怕对于那些观察力已经变得敏锐的人来说，真相也已经无法辨别了——或者说至少是无法轻易辨别了，于是在这种情况下，人们常常需要花费极大的努力才能最终找到真相。

For a person who strives toward a higher spiritual awareness it is often extremely difficult to know how to behave when such tests come along, for the dark forces know only too well how to make untruth appear as truth, truth as untruth, good as evil, evil as good. And so humans get confused—they who actually want so much to be in truth. They no longer know how to act in the right way. Often their own inner sick currents, of which they are unaware, contribute not only to darken the situation further, but also prevent them from perceiving it with clarity and thus from knowing how to deal with it.

对于一个致力于努力追求更高的精神觉悟的人来说，在这些考验到来的时候想要弄清楚应该怎么表现通常就变得极为困难，因为黑暗性质的力量太了解怎样让非真相显现为真相，真相显现为假相，善良显为邪恶，邪恶显为善良。于是就这样，人类变得糊涂了——而他们本身其实非常想处在真相中。他们不再知道怎样行动才是正确的。多数情况是，他们内心存在一些病态趋势、暗流，而他们对此并不知情，这些状况不但进一步恶化了局势，同时，还阻止了他们以清晰的思路看清这个情况进而了解怎样处理这种局势的可能性。

In order to part the dark clouds and see the truth it is important for everyone to be schooled in spiritual awareness and, according to your level, undertake to develop yourself to your utmost capacity. Otherwise you too will, in a different way, again in unawareness, become a plaything of the forces of darkness, your boat will be blown hither and thither, and you will no longer be able to steer, or steer it as well as possible. Neither can you, when trying to see the truth and perceive the core of the problem, dissipate the heavy clouds by yourself.
为了能离开这些乌云并且看到真相，重要的是每个人都在精神觉悟领域接受训练并且，根据你相应的程度，实际着手发挥你最大限度的能力来发展自己。不然你又会，以另一种方式，又是在未察觉的状况下，成为黑暗力量的玩物，你的船会被吹到此处彼处，而你无法再掌舵，或者无法尽可能好地掌舵。同时当你试图看清真相并觉察问题的本质的时候，你也无法通过自己的力量驱散沉重的谜云。

You can know what to do or not to do to contribute your energy to the service of the good only when you go on a path such as this. Then you can learn the discipline to go into your inner stillness at any time—especially when the wild storms are raging—and make contact with God and His divine spirits. Then you can open yourself to the inspiration of truth by observing yourself with all your faults, conquering all resistance.

只有当你走上（自我净化）这样一条道路的时候，你才能知道在你想为美好事物服务而贡献自己的能量时该干什么或者不该干什么。之后你就可以形成一种修养，使你可以在任意时刻——尤其是风暴肆虐的时候——进入内心平静的状态，并且与上帝和祂的神圣魂灵们开启接触。之后你就可以通过观察、内省找到自己的错误，征服所有阻力，进而敞开自己来接受真理带来的灵感。

The spiritual laws can, and should, be made a living reality on three different levels—and the higher the person’s development, the deeper it is possible to penetrate into these levels. They are: Doing, thinking and feeling.
精神法则可以，并且应该，从3个不同水平上被转变为鲜活的现实——并且一个人的发展程度越高，就越有可能洞悉到这些层次的更深处。这些层次分别是：行动，思想和感觉。

The most difficult task is on the emotional level. This is the highest level, because, first of all, many feelings are unconscious and you need work, willpower, and patience to make them conscious, and furthermore one cannot control one’s feelings as immediately and directly as one’s thoughts or actions. It requires laborious work on the spiritual level, self-analysis, and the thorough absorption of spiritual laws before the emotions can even begin to change.

最困难的工作存在于情感层次。这是最高的层次，因为，首先，许多感觉是潜意识的，所以你需要经营、意志力和耐心才能把他们变为清醒意识，同时人不能立刻、直接地像控制思想和行为一样控制自己的感觉。这需要精神层次的辛苦工作、自我分析以及全面彻底地吸收精神法则，在这之后，情感才会开始变化。

The less developed a person is, the more superficial his or her understanding of and adherence to the spiritual laws must be. This is why God gave humankind first the Ten Commandments. They deal with actions. “Thou shalt not steal.”  “Thou shalt not lie,” and so on. This was already a lot to take in for the average person of that time, and still is for certain groups of people who are incarnated from lower spheres.
一个人的发展程度越低，他或她对于精神法则的理解力和依附度就一定会越肤浅。这就是为什么上帝首先给了人类《十诫》。它们是关于行为的。“祢不可偷盗。”“祢不可撒谎。”等等。这对于当时那个时代的普通人来说已经是很多要消化的了，而对于某些从更低阶层面化身为人的群体人群来说现在仍然是这样。

The next stage is to cultivate one’s thoughts. Quite often a person acts rightly, but the thoughts run another course; people act rightly because they comprehend that otherwise they would get into trouble with the outside world, but it is still difficult for them to control their thoughts, and they often desire things which are not in accord with the divine laws. They have not yet understood that the impure thoughts and feelings must lead them into the same conflict within themselves since all thoughts and feelings have a form and a substance in spirit and thus bring about outer effects and chain reactions, even though they are unable to perceive them as such right away. Such an overview requires a spiritual awareness that can come only through higher development. Thus Christ brought you an expanded understanding of the divine laws and commandments and taught that you can sin also in thought. At his time humanity was beginning to become ready for this expanded awareness and depth of perception. And today humanity begins to be receptive to an even deeper spiritual understanding.

下一个阶段是培养一个人的思想。经常有的人表现很正确，但是想法却朝着另一个方向；人们表现得正常是因为他们领会到如果不这样他们会跟外部世界产生矛盾冲突，但是对他们来说控制思想仍然很困难，而且他们经常渴望那些与神圣法则不相符的东西。他们还没有理解到的事实是：不纯洁的想法和感觉必然会引导他们进入相同的自我内部矛盾，因为所有的思想和感觉在精神领域内都有相应的形态和实体，因此会带来外部表现和链式反应，尽管他们没有能力立刻看清这些后果的本质。这样的总揽能力需要一种只有通过更高的发展才能获得的精神觉悟力。于是基督给你们带来了一个扩增了的对于神圣法则和戒条的理解，并告诉你们人通过思想也能犯罪。在他的年代人类刚开始准备好消化这种延伸过的觉悟和这种感知深度。而今天人类开始能觉察到更加深入的精神理解力。

People in the second stage, who are doing their utmost to work on the level of thoughts and are purifying them, are well ahead of those who have only reached the stage of keeping the laws to the extent of outer actions. But you, my dear friends, must learn to reach deeper than that and come to your real feelings, to those which remain so often in the unconscious, which are so readily covered up by pretexts, and about which it is so easy to deceive yourselves, so as not to have to look at what is really there. Such self-deception must inevitably bring you into conflict with yourself and often also with your environment; this is so, even if you refuse to acknowledge the true origin of the conflicts. It is difficult enough to purify one’s thoughts. Therefore, to have to recognize that many of your feelings still deviate quite a bit from your thoughts or conscious intentions is rather painful.
处在第二阶段的人们，他们在尽全力经营自己的思想层面并且着手净化它们，这些人远远领先于那些刚到达在外部行为层面遵守法则阶段的人们。但你们，我亲爱的朋友们，必须学会到达比那更深的层次从而到达你们的真实感觉，到达那些经常是保留在潜意识的、轻而易举被借口掩饰起来的，并且很容易就此欺骗自己以至于不用看到那里真正有什么的地方。这种自我欺骗必定不可避免地将你带入与自我和与你的环境的冲突中；它就是这样的，哪怕你拒绝接受这些冲突的真正起源。单单净化自己的思想就已经是一件很困难的事情了。在此之上一个人还必须要意识到，他许多内在感觉仍然会很大程度上偏离自己的思想与清醒的意图，因此，要面对这个事实（在一开始的时候）是相当令人痛苦的。
It is just this extra effort that God wants everybody to make. The last stage and deepening of consciousness is of course the most difficult to reach, this is the goal to which you all aspire: it is the true purification. Those who can bring their innermost feelings into their consciousness and are willing to recognize that these feelings do not always run parallel with what they have accepted as right in their thoughts, have already accomplished a great deal. If you work on this continuously until you slowly acquire mastery in it, you can penetrate not only into your own truth, but can then find, at times of trial, in difficult situations, the core of truth. Then you can scatter the clouds, then you can untangle the ball of threads, knot by knot. For only those who courageously face themselves again and again—and here vanity is an insurmountable obstacle—can gain true perspective of another human being or of any outer situation. Those who are blind to their own truth must be blind to the truth of others.
而这份额外努力，正是上帝希望所有人都做出的。这个对知觉意识的加深的最终阶段当然是最难以达到的，但这是你们所有人都向往的目标：它是真正意义上的净化。那些能够把内心最深处的感觉带到意识表面，并且有意愿认识到这些感觉并不总是与在他们的思想里被接受为正确的事物相一致的人，其实已经完成了很多工作了。如果你能在这方面持续地努力，直到慢慢地你掌握了其中的要领，你就能领会到不仅仅是你自我的真相，还能在试炼的时刻到来时或者处境艰难时发现，真相的核心。之后你就可以驱散云雾，再然后你可以理顺线条绕成的球，每次解开一个结。因为只有那些鼓起勇气一次又一次面对自己的人——在这里，自负与虚荣是一道不可逾越的障碍——才能获得真正客观的视角，不管是关于另外一个个体还是任何外界情镜。那些对于他们自己的真相视而不见的人，必然会对其他人的真相视而不见。
The knots and tangles are also spiritual forms which are a reality, my dear ones. We can always observe them around each group of people. Everybody adds his share to the tangle of threads, woven by the dark forces; and often one person contributes especially much to create tangles and achieve greater and greater confusion. But if there is one person in a group who takes the direct and spiritual high road, who truly confronts himself day by day, he or she is the one who will eventually—I repeat, not from one day to the next—succeed in loosening one knot after the other, until there are none left and everything becomes clear. Then the weak person will not be able to deceive himself any longer either, which anyway was most detrimental to himself and had burdened his progress. Of course, at first he will put up a resistance, because confusion feeds the lower self that prefers the road of least resistance and vanity, practices self-deception and thrives on discord. But, in the long run, even a weak person will feel liberated as the clouds disappear from his or her life. When truth illuminates with its clarity a previously obscure situation, there will be no more questions left as to what is the right attitude, what is just, and what is the right action.
这些绳结和纠缠的团同时也有各自相应的精神形态，这些形态是一个现实，我亲爱的人们。我们总是可以在每个群体中观察到它们。每个人都把自己那一份纠缠的线条加入进来，这些线条被黑暗力量编织；而通常有一个人贡献了特别多的纠缠，从而形成了越来越严重的混淆。但是，如果在一个群体中有这么一个人，他能够打通那条直达的、精神的大路，每天能够真正直面自己，那么他或者她就是那个能够最终——我强调，不是从前一天到下一天——成功解开一个又一个绳结的人，直到最终绳结一个都不见了，然后所有事情变得清晰起来。这样就连软弱的人也无法继续欺骗自己了，而这个过程本来就是对他自己极为有害并且阻碍了他的进程。当然了，一开始他会发起抵抗，因为混淆困惑滋养着低级自我，而低级自我喜欢阻力最小的道路以及自负与虚荣，实行自我欺骗并且在不调和的环境中最为如鱼得水。但是，长远看来，就连懦弱的人也会在谜云从他或她的生命中消失时感觉到某种解放。当真相用它的澄明照亮一个之前昏暗晦涩的情境时，就不会有任何关于什么是正确的态度，什么是正义的，以及什么是正确的行为的问题了。
Everybody has enough self-knowledge—or should strive to reach this point—to ask herself or himself, “What am I able to do to contribute my share to God’s Plan of Salvation?”  Many do not have as their task anything that would create public attention. But quietly, for their own sake, everybody can and should start to fulfill their part. For all have their tasks within the plan, even the weakest. For them it may suffice and perhaps mean the maximum of achievement to cast off a particular fault, to set something right with a fellow human being with whom they were incarnated for that purpose, to align their actions with God’s laws, and to refrain from giving in to their lowest instincts. More is required of others; of everyone always what is most difficult, what needs the greatest perseverance; all purify themselves and develop within the capacity of their level and strength.
每个人都有足够的自我认识——或者应该努力达到这一点——来询问他或她自己，“我能做哪些力所能及的事来贡献给上帝的拯救计划？”很多人的任务都不是去做任何会引起公众注意的事。但是僻静地，每个人都可以并应该开始完成他们各自的角色。因为所有人都在计划之内有一份任务，哪怕是最软弱的人。对他们来说，足够多或者是顶峰的成就就是改掉某个错误；或者把他们自己跟另一个人的某个关系理顺，而那个人的生命目的也正是如此；或者把他们的行为朝上帝的法则靠拢；或者克制自己不向最低级的本能屈服。更多的要求会向其他人提出；每个人的任务都是对他们来说最难的，需要最多的毅力和韧性的；所有人都在他们相应的层次和能力之内净化和发展自己。
For those who are more advanced in their development, this process of purification automatically leads to the ability to disentangle the knots in their surroundings and to clear up confused situations. Thus they accomplish something they were meant to do and contribute to God’s Plan of Salvation, in which each act of cooperation counts so much. And then further tasks will be found.
对于那些在自我发展中更加先进的人们来说，这个净化过程自动地带来那种在他们的周围环境中解开症结并弄清混乱的局势的能力。于是他们完成了一些他们注定要做的工作并且为上帝的拯救计划做了贡献，此计划中每一个合作的行为都意义重大。之后进一步的任务会被发现。
You human beings want to be happy, all of you, and of course we understand this. Without the yearning for happiness and perfection in the human soul, there would be no spiritual development. But there are only very few who ask, “What can I give?  What can I contribute to God’s Plan of Salvation?”  You are always demanding something, not necessarily in direct prayer for the fulfillment of this or that wish, but with your self-will, your feelings, and often even in your thinking. You want the best for yourself and are unhappy over the difficulties of life.
你们人类希望变得快乐，所有人都是这样，而当然我们理解这一点。假如人类灵魂中没有对于快乐和完美的渴望，那么就不会有精神发展和进步。但是只有很少的人会问，“我能给予什么？我能为上帝的拯救计划贡献什么？”你们总是在请求什么——并不一定是在直接的祈祷语中祈求这个或那个愿望的实现，而是通过你们的自我意志、你们的感觉、甚至经常在思考中祈求什么。你们想要给自己最好的并且对于生活的困难显得不开心。
Have you ever asked God, “What can I do for you?”  For those who claim their own happiness as the ultimate goal—which is usually the case, even if you are not conscious of it—break the cycle of the living flow of energy which is the basis of everything that is spiritual. And the moment the cycle is interrupted, it is also dead. Let us suppose that a particular wish of yours has been granted. If the good you have received has its ultimate goal in yourself, it cannot remain alive in you, and therefore your happiness will be of short duration. Only those who keep the cycle actively flowing by being constantly conscious of and inspired by the desire to put to spiritual use and into the service of God’s Plan of Salvation all that they have received in help and grace, in happiness and fulfillment, in divine intervention and guidance, and act and feel accordingly, will also be able to sustain and keep alive their own happiness.
你有没有这样问过上帝，“我能为祢做什么？”对于那些把自己的幸福宣称为最终极目的的人——这通常是事实，哪怕你对此不自觉——打破了活生生的能量流的循环，而这种循环是所有精神物质运转的基础。在这个循环被干扰的那一刻，它也就死了。让我们假定说，你的某一个特定愿望被准许了。假如你从中得到的好处的终极目的在于你自身，那么它在你这儿就没法保持存活，于是你的幸福就会是短暂的。只有那些保持循环积极流动的人，只有通过变得对一种渴望保持时刻清晰和不断受到鼓舞的人——这种愿望就是开展精神活动，参与为上帝的拯救计划服务，而在此过程中将会在帮助和恩典、幸福和满足、神圣干预和指导中得到收获，并且依此行事和感受——将能够维持他们自己的幸福并使它保持新鲜与活力。
You can and should allow God to guide you, so that you can achieve this goal. A person who does this is indeed a participant in the divine order and his or her happiness will never become shallow, or dry out, or die, but will always be alive, pulsating, forever regenerating itself. And only a person with this kind of intentionality is worthy of special guidance and divine help.
你可以也应该允许上帝指引你，这样你就能完成这个目标。一个做到这一点的人确实就是神圣秩序的参与者，因此他或她的幸福快乐就永远不会变得肤浅，或者干涸，或者死去，而总会是鲜活的、搏动的，永远自我再生。同时也只有有着这种意图的人才配得上拥有特殊引导和神圣助力。
Yes, my dear ones, few people think this way. They go to God and make wishes and demands, but they are not willing to give anything to God’s world, to the great struggle which is so crucial. Think about this, all of you. All who approach God in this way can be given more light and help to disentangle the knots and to have the strength to steer their little boat well, even through a storm, so that they come through it strengthened and enlightened, as is the will of God.
是的，我亲爱的人们，很少有人这样思考。他们走向上帝然后提出愿望和要求，但他们不愿意为上帝的世界提供任何东西，不愿为如此关键的奋斗提供任东西。考虑下这一点，你们所有人。所有以这种方式接近上帝的人会被给予更多的光与帮助来解除绳结并拥有安稳掌舵他们的小船的力量，哪怕面临风暴，从而能经历风暴并变强，变得开明，如同上帝的本意。
